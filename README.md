#purpose
>This project is about to design a new programming language for note taking,
>Called SNAIL.
>We programmers deserve better tools for taking note, I just finnished the
>Compiler course on Coursera, so I am now be able to write a compiler myself :)

#progress
>* vim syntax file: finished first edition
>* lexer: finished, seems working
>* parser: most of it, I haven't debug yet

#plan
>1. finish debuging parser.
>2. simple type checking.
>3. implement code generation as a XML form.

#note
>* how ever I cannot promise keep working on the project everyday
because I am pretty snowed under collage study :-( 


>* Writing a SNL is more like list all the nodes of a tree, then talks about
connection between nodes.

>* I'm considering compiling SNL languages to XML in the end. It is a good
option, xml is not good enough for reading

>* XML is for storing tree data, but SNL is meant for storing set and graph (I
havent come out a solution to combine these set and graph)
